    /// Withdrawn striker/deep-lying forward/second forward (WF)
    /// The withdrawn striker plays behind the forward. It is typical in attacking football strategies to put him as the main scorer while the person in front of him serves as decoy. The deep-lying forward is often utilized in the 4-4-2 formation.
    /// A deep-lying forward must have excellent passing skills as he is expected to feed the striker and at the same time possess technical abilities with the ball as he often receives back passes from the striker
