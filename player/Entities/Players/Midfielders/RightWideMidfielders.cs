    /// (RW) The winger plays the same role as the attacking midfielder but he focuses his attacks from the side. This position is often utilized in “odd” formations like 4-3-3 and 4-5-1.
    /// Since the winger often plays between the midfield and the offensive line, he is sometimes classified as a forward. A player who occupies this position must be fast, have excellent dribbling abilities, and accurate with passes.
    /// A modern winger is typically flexible and can attack from the center, which makes him take over the role of a forward.
