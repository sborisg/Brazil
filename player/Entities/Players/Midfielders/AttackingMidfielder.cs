    /// (AM) The attacking midfielder is an advanced midfield player who is primarily inclined to attack. He must have excellent ball control abilities and tactical awareness.
    /// A playmaker occupies the same position as an attacking midfielder but performs a different role. This guy is considered the brain of the team, the most skilled player who orchestrates the attack and distributes the ball. A playmaker must be good in decision-making and as the football saying goes: when you don’t know what to do with the ball, you pass it to him.
